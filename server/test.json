This includes cleaning, filtering, validating, and integrating the data, ensuring it meets the required quality and consistency standards. \n\n## Load: \n- In the final stage, the transformed data is loaded into the target system, data warehouse, or database. This could involve simply inserting the data or using more complex loading techniques depending on the system and data volume. \n\nThe ETL process is a critical component of data management and analytics, ensuring that data is consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis or reporting.
